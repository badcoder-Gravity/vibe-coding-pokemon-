# vibe-coding-pokemon- 
A visually appealing "vibe-coding" project that lets users explore the first 50 well known Pokémon in a deep-space environment. This project features glassmorphism UI, a moving starfield, and smooth diagonal transitions.

## Features  
* **Deep Space Atmosphere:** A multi-layered, moving star background.  
* **Diagonal Transitions:** Pokémon appear from the top-right haze into the center-left.  
* **Interactive Data Hub:** A side-bar chart to quickly jump to any of the 50 Pokémon.  
* **Responsive Glassmorphism:** A modern, blurred interface for Pokémon descriptions.  
* **Dynamic Data:** Powered by the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Tech Stack  
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.  
* **CSS3:** Custom animations, Flexbox/Grid, and parallax effects.  
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Async/Await for fetching data from the API and manipulating the DOM.

## Preview  
"When the user clicks 'Next Sector,' a new Pokémon appears from the cosmic fog with a large photo and detailed description."
